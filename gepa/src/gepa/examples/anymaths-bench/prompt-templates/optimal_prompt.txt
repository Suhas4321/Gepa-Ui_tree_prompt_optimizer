### Task Instruction: Solve Multi-Step Mathematical Problems with Precision and Contextual Understanding

You are tasked with solving problems that require careful parsing of contextual information, breaking down multi-step calculations, and ensuring accuracy in arithmetic and logical reasoning. Follow these steps to address diverse problem types (e.g., percentages, cost calculations, score determination, and distance computations):

---

#### **1. Parse the Problem**
- **Identify Key Values**: Extract numbers, percentages, fractions, and relationships (e.g., "40% of 60 students," "6 more than half of Ella\'s score").
- **Understand Relationships**: Determine if values are additive, multiplicative, or comparative (e.g., "round trips" imply doubling one-way distances, "cost per item" requires multiplication).
- **Clarify Ambiguities**: Resolve unclear phrasing (e.g., "half the score" refers to half the total items, not half the incorrect answers).

---

#### **2. Break Down the Problem**
- **Segment into Steps**: Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts (e.g., calculate individual components before summing).
- **Apply Formulas**: Use appropriate mathematical operations (e.g., percentage = part/whole × 100, total cost = (item count × price)).
- **Account for Context**: Adjust calculations based on problem specifics (e.g., "round trip" requires doubling one-way distance, "score" may involve subtracting incorrect answers from total items).

---

#### **3. Perform Calculations**
- **Use Precise Arithmetic**:
    - For percentages: $ \\text{Percentage} \\times \\text{Total} $.
    - For fractions: $ \\frac{\\text{Numerator}}{\\text{Denominator}} \\times \\text{Value} $.
    - For multi-step operations: Follow order of operations (PEMDAS) and verify intermediate results.
- **Avoid Common Errors**:
    - Misinterpreting phrases like "half the score" (e.g., half of total items, not half of incorrect answers).
    - Confusing "round trips" (up + down) with single trips.
    - Incorrectly applying percentages to the wrong base (e.g., 40% of students vs. 40% of total score).

---

#### **4. Validate the Answer**
- **Check Logical Consistency**: Ensure results align with problem constraints (e.g., total students = sum of groups, total cost = sum of individual costs).
- **Verify Units and Formatting**: Confirm answers match required formats (e.g., boxed numbers, currency symbols, or percentage notation).
- **Cross-Validate with Examples**: Compare calculations against similar problems (e.g., "If 40% of 60 students = 24, then 60 - 24 = 36").

---

#### **5. Finalize the Response**
- **Present the Answer Clearly**: Use the exact format requested (e.g., `\boxed{36}` for numerical answers, `$77.00` for currency).
- **Include Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Explicitly show calculations (e.g., `18 * $2.50 = $45.00`, `8 * $4.00 = $32.00`).
- **Highlight Key Decisions**: Note critical choices (e.g., "Half of Ella's score = 36 items / 2 = 18 items").

### **Examples of Problem Types**
1. **Percentage Problems**:
    - *Input*: "40% of 60 students got below B."
    - *Solution*: $ 0.40 \\times 60 = 24 $, $ 60 - 24 = 36 $.
2. **Cost Calculations**:
    - *Input*: "18 knobs at $2.50 each and 8 pulls at $4.00 each."
    - *Solution*: $ 18 \\times 2.50 + 8 \\times 4.00 = 45 + 32 = 77 $.
3. **Score Determination**:
    - *Input*: "Ella got 4 incorrect answers; Marion got 6 more than half of Ella's score."
    - *Solution*: Total items = 40, Ella's correct = 36, half = 18, Marion = 18 + 6 = 24.

### **Key Niche Information**
- **Percentages**: Always apply to the total (e.g., 40% of 60 students = 24 students, not 40% of 40 items).
- **Round Trips**: Double one-way distances (e.g., 30,000 feet up + 30,000 feet down = 60,000 per trip).
- **Score Calculations**: Subtract incorrect answers from total items (e.g., 40 items - 4 incorrect = 36 correct).
- **Currency Formatting**: Use decimal points and symbols (e.g., `$77.00`, not `77`).

---

### **Final Output Format**\nAlways conclude with:
    `Final Answer: \boxed{<result>}`
For non-numeric answers, use:
    `Final Answer: <result>`

Ensure calculations are explicitly shown and errors are corrected based on problem context.
